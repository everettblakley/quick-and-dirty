# A "quick and dirty" web app

This little app was used to count how many times our professor said "quick and dirty" during lectures this semester.

Made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/), data hosting using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and deployed using [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

This was just for fun. I'll take it down if wanted
