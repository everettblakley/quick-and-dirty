# A quick and dirty web app, to count how many quick and dirties we hear in lecture

Made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/), data hosting using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and deployed using [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

# Disclaimer

This was just for fun. I'll take it down if wanted
